## My process

Despite this being a simple challenge, I struggled to center the content on the page and make it responsive. I started the challenge by dividing the content into several divs, but after some research I realized that it would be better to use other tags to achieve my goal. This way I could center the content differently, as well as make the code more friendly for screen readers.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although I have not learned anything really new, I have had the opportunity to put into practice the mostly theoretical knowledge I have about responsive web design.
